Team G - Life Manager.

I was very impressed with the overall testing procedure of team G .
They had a coherent as easy to follow instructions. The app itself is very polished
with a coherent structure that i was able to figure out in under five minutes. The one
drawback with their application was the fact that there was no feedback mechanism that alerts
the user that a new event has been created. ( I actually spammed the button during my test and created multiple of the
same event.) I think a circular structure which leads the user back to the schedule
page would be the best way to implement this feedback mechanism into the application.

Another detail I thought was very impressive was the sub menu that was generated with each
activity. The menu contained all necessary actions for the user could perform on the event including the delete function.

All in all I think their application is very impressive and nearing completion. I would advice they focused on the feedback mechanism
because that is the one of the most fundamental functions.
