Changed
- App is not indexable by Google Search; consider adding at least one Activity with an ACTION-VIEW intent filter. See issue explanation for more details.  - AndroidManifest.xml

- Field can be converted to a local variable -in MainActivity

- 'if' statement replaceable with 'switch' statement in MainActivity

- Changed the 'dp' to 'sp' for the textsizes-  in activity.xml


Not Changed
- Missing accessibility label: provide either a view with an 'android:labelFor' that references this view or provide an 'android:hint' in activity.xml
I did not make this change because no hint was required for the integer text input. Adding a hint would have meant hardcoding the hint into the method and not jus the xml file.
