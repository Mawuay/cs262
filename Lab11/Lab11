Changed
- App is not indexable by Google Search; consider adding at least one Activity with an ACTION-VIEW intent filter. - AndroidManifest.xml

- Field can be converted to a local variable -in MainActivity

 - 'if' statement replaceable with 'switch' statement in MainActivity


Not Changed
Missing accessibility label: provide either a view with an 'android:labelFor' that references this view or provide an 'android:hint' in activity.xml
 This was not changed because i did not feel the hint was necessary to instruct user as to what kind of input to use.
