1.
	a.	The service is RESTful. It is stateless, and provides the data through JSON. Further, our URIs are directory-structure-like showing an intuitive type of hierarchy.
	b.	GET, POST, and DELETE are idempotent. They can be called as many times as we want, and they would yield the same result as just calling it once. Post is a nullipotent endpoint. If we call it twice, it creates two identical copies of the same thing.
	c.	There may be some evidence of an impedance mismatch as the PSQL database is mapped to a JDBC model.
	d.	Our web service is protected against SQL injection as queries are limited by the server.
