a.	There are 3 API endpoints: player, players, and players/id.


b.
		i)	JDBC is the method for accessing data from a database.

		ii)	1. SQL query statements are specific request submitted to a database to access information. The JDBC statement object is an interface which provides an avenue for SQL statements to be executed.

				2. An SQL relation is a table in an SQL database. The JDBC results set on the other hand is a subset of the whole results table, with its own java class representations. This is different from a List<Player> because the data is not stored in an object, but merely is a list of entries, each with fields with data. We then have to build a Player object from this data.

    iii) This function is useful when providing the syntax for an SQL Query and wish for the "NULL" to be without quotes, as appropriate.


c.
		i)	This allows us to represent a Player in the Object-oriented world of Java, allowing us to easily translate the non-object-oriented data in the database into a format which is easily workable in Java.

    ii) It seems fairly similar, as it has the same three fields - an ID and two string values.
